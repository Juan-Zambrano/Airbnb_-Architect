Figure 1: Compare the median price of Airbnb and the price of Zillow
From this graph, we can see an overall increasing trend between date and median price in both Airbnb 
and Zillow dataset. That indicates the price of the house is increasing regardless short term or long term rental. 
In both datasets, there are some significant increase during the summer seasons.


Figure 2: Zillow monthly price linear relationship with the crossover point
The crossover point represents the number of days per month that an Airbnb host would need to rent
out his/her property in order to earn the same amount of revenue as from a median long-term
rental. From the graph, we can tell there is a linear relationship between Zillow monthly price and 
crossover point, which makes sense, because the highest Zillow monthly price is, the longest that Airbnb 
host need to rent out their property in order to get the same revenue as the Zillow rental.



Figure 3: The average price of a different number of the bedroom in the house.
From this graph, we can see a different trend between Zillow and Airbnb dataset of the number of the bedroom.
In the Airbnb dataset, the average price for each bedroom is proportional to the number of bedrooms,
and the average price is very steady compared to the Zillow dataset. For example, one bedroom in five 
bedrooms house has the highest average price. In the Zillow dataset, the average price is not proportional to
the number of bedrooms, the price is very unsteady. For instance, one bedroom in a one bedroom house has the 
highest average price.
